SpinBot is a type of AdvancedRobot. 
It is initialized by setting: 
	bodyColor to Color.blue
	gunColor to Color.blue
	radarColor to Color.black
	scanColor to Color.yellow
	
The behaviour is defined in the infinite loop by setting: 
	turnRight to 10000
	maxVelocity to 5
	ahead to 10000

When the SpinBot gets the ScannedRobot event, it will set/execute: 
	fire to 3
	
When the SpinBot gets the HitRobot event, it will set/execute: 
	fire to 3   ->   on the Condition:  {  e.getBearing() > -10 && e.getBearing() < 10  }
	turnRight to 10   ->   on the Condition:  {  e.isMyFault()    }
