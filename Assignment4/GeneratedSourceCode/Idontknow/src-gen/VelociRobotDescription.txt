VelociRobot is a type of RangeControlRobot. 
It is initialized by setting: 
	GunRotationRate to 15
	
The behaviour is defined in the infinite loop by setting: 
	TurnRate to 0   ->   on the Condition:  {  turnCounter%64 == 0  }
	VelocityRate to 4   ->   on the Condition:  {  turnCounter%64 == 0  }
	VelocityRate to -6   ->   on the Condition:  {  turnCounter%64 == 32  }
	execute to 

When the VelociRobot gets the ScannedRobot event, it will set/execute: 
	fire to 1
	
When the VelociRobot gets the HitByBullet event, it will set/execute: 
	TurnRate to 4
	
When the VelociRobot gets the HitWall event, it will set/execute: 
	VelocityRate to "-1 * getVelocityRate()"
